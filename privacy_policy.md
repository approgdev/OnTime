Last updated: 13/11/2025

On Time (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects and protects your privacy.
This Privacy Policy describes how On Time handles your information and explains your rights regarding data privacy.

1. Information We Collect
On Time does not collect, store, or share any personal data on external servers.
All information generated while using the app, including work sessions, time records, settings, themes and language preferences — is stored locally on your device only.
We do not transmit, analyze or sell any data to third parties.

2. Use of Data
Because no personal data is collected or transmitted, On Time does not use your information for any purpose beyond providing app functionality.

3. Advertising and Analytics
At this time, On Time does not display ads and does not use analytics tools

4. Data Storage and Security
All app data is stored only on your device.

5. Data Retention and Deletion
You can permanently delete your data at any time by:
 Uninstalling the app;
 Using your device’s “Clear data” or “Reset app” options;
After uninstalling the app, all data is permanently erased from your device.

6. Children’s Privacy
On Time is intended for general use and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction).
Since the app stores all data locally and does not collect or transmit any information, no child-specific data is ever accessed or retained.

7. Your Rights
Because no personal data is collected or stored externally, there is no need to request access, correction or deletion of your data.
You retain full control of your information on your own device.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in app functionality or legal requirements.
Any updates will be posted within the app and/or on the app store listing with the new “Last updated” date.
