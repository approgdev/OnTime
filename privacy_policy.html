  <h1>Privacy Policy for On Time</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: 13/11/2025</strong></p>

  <p>
    On Time (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects and protects your privacy.
    This Privacy Policy describes how On Time handles your information and explains
    your rights regarding data privacy.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    On Time does not collect, store or share any personal data on external servers.
    All information generated while using the app, including work sessions, time records,
    settings, themes and language preferences, is stored locally on your device only.
    We do not transmit, analyze or sell any data to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Use of Data</h2>
  <p>
    Because no personal data is collected or transmitted, On Time does not use your
    information for any purpose beyond providing app functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    At this time, On Time does not display ads and does not use analytics tools.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All app data is stored only on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You can permanently delete your data at any time by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uninstalling the app</li>
    <li>Using your device’s “Clear data” or “Reset app” options</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After uninstalling the app, all data is permanently erased from your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    On Time is intended for general use and does not knowingly collect personal
    information from children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age
    in your jurisdiction). Since the app stores all data locally and does not collect
    or transmit any information, no child-specific data is ever accessed or retained.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Because no personal data is collected or stored externally, there is no need to request
    access, correction or deletion of your data. You retain full control of your information
    on your own device.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in app functionality
    or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted within the app and/or on the app store
    listing with the new “Last updated” date.
  </p>

    On Time’s data handling practices, you can contact us at:
